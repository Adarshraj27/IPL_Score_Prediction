# IPL_Score_Prediction

Predicting IPL scores using ridge and lasso regression involves several steps, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Hereâ€™s a general outline of how you can do this using Python and libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy:

1. Data Collection
First, you need historical IPL match data, which typically includes details like match date, team names, venue, scores, player statistics, etc.

2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning Data: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features such as average player scores, team performance metrics, weather conditions, etc.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data (e.g., team names) into numerical data using techniques like one-hot encoding.
3. Splitting the Data
Divide the data into training and test sets.

4. Model Training
Train the ridge and lasso regression models on the training data.

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models on the test set using metrics like mean squared error (MSE).
